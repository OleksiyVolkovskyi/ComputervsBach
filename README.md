# ComputervsBach
Machine learning used in order to teach a computer how to compose music.

This is a repository of my entire project.

In this project, I used Andrej Karpathy's LSTM in order to teach a computer to compose music.
I downloaded Bach's compositions in the Midi format, translated them to .txt through multiple steps, ran them through
Andrej Karpathy's LSTM, then translated the output file back into music.

You can listen to the output for yourself by going into the "Final" folder and playing the midi files. The final.midi piece is
what my computer composed after studying Bach's music for 12 hours on rnn_size 400 and 2 layers.
